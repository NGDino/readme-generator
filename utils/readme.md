  # Session Scheduler

  ## Description

  Session Scheduler is a dynamic program to book an appointment using Calandarly API.  When a user navigates to your “schedule a session page” , they are prompted with an input form.  This can be customized to your specific business but will collect details on the services they require, how many people joining them, and let them pick a date and time that works for them.  If a session is unavailable they will not be able to select it.

  ## Installation

  As part of purchasing this service, Dino Development Corp will install this program and have it up and running for you at no additional cost.

  ## Usage

  With the Covid-19 pandemic it is a requirement for wineries to take reservations, and limit their capacity.  This application will seamlessly allow customers to schedule their own appointment and only allow them to pick a time that has open availability.  To set the parameters for how many timeslots you have, what services are offered, etc. there will be a separate page with inputs that will control the parameters.  This page will only be accessible to those who know the URL and will be password protected.  Once they have selected an available timeslot a confirmation email will be automatically sent to the customer.   If you have a customer call in to make a reservation you can simply enter their name into your calendar manually and this will be factored in when making additional reservations.
